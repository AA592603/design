## Usage

A skeleton bone can be any size or shape, and may be used to render a skeleton loader to replace content that cannot accurately be replaced by a skeleton avatar or skeleton text component.

<Box
  mb={3}
  display="flex"
  alignItems="flex-start"
  justifyContent="space-between"
  flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']}
  sx={{gap: 3}}
>

For example, you may want to render a skeleton loader in place of a hero image in a content card that is still loading.

<img
  src=""
  role="presentation"
  width="456"
/>

</Box>
